# Plymouth theme - Simple Image

This is a theme for plymouth which only displays a simple image. The current image is a simple logo for ArchLinux.

To change the image, you can simple change the `img.png` to whatever you want to show.

This package is avaliable on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/plymouth-theme-simple-image-git).

_The current background is borrowed from [Litarvan's](https://github.com/Litarvan) excellent [lightdm theme](https://github.com/Litarvan/lightdm-webkit-theme-litarvan)._
